# Simon Game with Arduino

Such an interesting project for beginners to get acquainted with Arduino programming and basic electronic circuits with LEDs and buttons.

Simon Game, as you may know, is a memory test in which different LEDs light up following a random sequence. By pushing the buttons in the correct order, the sequence gets longer and longer, making it more difficult to follow. How long can you hold?

Possible updates:

- Place a passive buzzer instead of the green and red LEDs and make it sound with different frequencies to indicate:
1. The beginning of the game.
2. The sequence has been followed correctly. Well done!
3. The sequence has been followed wrongly. Game over!

- Implement an LCD (or a 7-segment display) to show the number of elements that the sequence has, thus how many levels have been passed.
